<!-- Hi there! I'm PQ. I’m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my personal website](https://www.lenpaul.com/) for more information on my other projects (including more Jekyll themes!), as well as some of my writing. -->

Hi there! I'm PQ. I’m nobody but a guy who is struggling to graduate from his Ph.D. program. Fortunately, I have someone that I love, my friends and family who really care out me. It is them who make my life full of sunshine.
